# enzyme-selectors

Other testing libraries like [react-testing-library](https://github.com/testing-library/react-testing-library) have popularized testing react-components by locating them by specific html-attributes that enforce best pactices for accessability. This little module brings the convenience of those selectors to enzyme.
